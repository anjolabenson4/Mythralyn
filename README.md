# 🧝 Mythralyn

**Mythralyn** is a decentralized fantasy realm powered by Web3 — where players truly own their heroes, artifacts, land, and legends.

Welcome to an immersive game ecosystem where every sword slash, every alliance, and every dragon slayed is recorded on-chain.

## 🧩 What Is Mythralyn?

**Mythralyn** is a blockchain-based, player-owned MMORPG (Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game) that blends rich lore, strategic gameplay, and digital ownership. It runs on smart contracts to enforce fair, transparent rules and supports player governance via a decentralized autonomous guild (DAG).

## 🔮 Key Features

- **On-chain Hero & Asset Ownership**  
  Heroes, mounts, gear, potions, and artifacts are all NFTs — tradable, upgradeable, and transferrable.

- **Land & Kingdom Economy**  
  Buy, trade, and develop land in Mythralyn. Establish markets, levy taxes, or forge alliances.

- **P2E (Play-to-Earn) Mechanics**  
  Battle in PvE or PvP and earn $MYTH tokens — the utility and governance token of Mythralyn.

- **Smart Contract Integrity**  
  All core game logic (quests, battles, item crafting, etc.) is enforced by Clarity smart contracts.

- **Lore-Based DAO Governance**  
  Players vote on major updates, events, and rulings through a story-integrated DAO.
